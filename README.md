# RailsWizard

**RailsWizard** is a web application that makes the generation of Rails 
application templates as easy as selecting a few options from a form.
You can see the application in action at [http://railswizard.org](http://railswizard.org).

RailsWizard was built for the [2010 Rails Rumble](http://railsrumble.com/teams/the-lonely-intridean)
by [Michael Bleigh](http://twitter.com/mbleigh) of [Intridea](http://intridea.com).
While it began as a Rails Rumble project, it will continue to grow in the future
as more features and recipes are added. RailsWizard is licensed under the **MIT License**,
so feel free to fork, play, and have fun.
